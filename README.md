# Insyt-Alpha
## What is Insyt?

This software is designed with the sole purpose of helping authorities and individuals tackle online abuse of others, it uses facial recognition APIs and webscraping to collate information which is already in the public domain.

## The elephant in the room

While Insyt does help identify people online, it is only licensed to the appropriate authorities, in order to prevent abuse and invasion of privacy. There is a huge ethical question surrounding facial recognition software and while developing Insyt this has been taken into careful consideration.

## Licensing

Insyt is not publicly available and is not publicly licensed. This means that you do not have permission to distribute, reproduce, or create derivative works from Insyt. The default copyright laws apply to Insyt and this is for a good reason.
